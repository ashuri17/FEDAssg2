## Theme: Gamer Crazy

### Flag Quiz
Brief Description:
Encourage users to improve their knowledge of world geography through a game.
### How does the game work?
A user is given a random image of a country flag and their task is to identify the name of the corresponding flag.
For every flag identified correctly, they will earn points that they can use as a currency to redeem items in our shop. Additionally,
users who can correctly identify flags consecutively will have a **Streak** score which is used as a metric for a leaderboard
system, giving further incentive for the users to keep attempting the game.
